    "# Multiple Sclerosis Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains a simple classifier for multiple sclerosis (MS) based on gene expression data. The goal of this project is to learn how to write a simple classifier for healthy and unhealthy patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is from a study comparing gene expression in peripheral blood samples between healthy human individuals and patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). The data was generated using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to identify differences in mRNA levels between the two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you prefer you can use alternative datasets, classifying different diseases. Data can be acquired [here](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments?experimentType=%22Differential%22&species=homo+sapiens). \n",
    "Choose datasets with at least two experimental factors. \n",
    "The default dataset (MS) was from [this](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-GEOD-66573/Results) link.\n",
    "In case you are unsure how to handle different datasets, an alternative [dataset](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-ENAD-46/Results) is included as an example and can be loaded by changing `DATASET = lung` further below.\n"

    "### Your Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Your main task is to improve the classifier by selecting better features. This involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Familiarize yourself with the covariance matrix:** The covariance matrix is a powerful tool for understanding the relationships between features. The current version of this notebook generates a covariance matrix for the first 5 genes.\n",
    "2.  **Normalization:** The data is normalized before calculating the covariance matrix. Why is this important? What would happen if you didn't normalize the data?\n",
    "3.  **Feature Selection:** The current version of the notebook only uses the first 5 genes as features. You should experiment with different sets of features to see if you can improve the accuracy of the classifier. You can use the information from the `query results` dataframe to select genes that are differentially expressed between the two groups.\n",
    "4.  **Interpret the covariance matrix:** What does it mean if a value in the covariance matrix is close to 0? What does it mean if it is close to 1? How can you use this information to select features?\n",
    "5.  **Implement k-fold cross validation:** Since we have limited data (only 14 samples total), a single train/test split may not give us a reliable estimate of model performance. Implement k-fold cross validation to get a more robust evaluation of your classifier. Consider what value of k would be appropriate given our small dataset size. Compare the results from k-fold cross validation with the simple train/test split approach currently used in the notebook."
